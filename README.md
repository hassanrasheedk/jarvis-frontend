# Jarvis-AI

A ThreeJS-powered virtual human being that uses a set of neat [Azure APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-speech-synthesis-viseme) to do some talking!

An AI agent that uses text-to-speech model and an LLM model to make conversation. Can be made into a full-fledged Jarvis (inspired by Iron Man) using speech-to-text -> LLM -> text-to-speech. Might be helpful debugging mechanical tasks? :thought_balloon:


## Run
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## Backend
You'll also need https://github.com/hassanrasheedk/jarvis-backend for the text to speech conversion.
